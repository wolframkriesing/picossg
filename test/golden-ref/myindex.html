<p>this file shall become &quot;/myindex.html&quot; just making sure the &quot;index.html&quot; in the name is not being screwed around with.
E.g. when building <code>prettyUrlPath</code> it should not become <code>/my</code> because just the trailing &quot;index.html&quot; is removed.
You know just making sure here :)</p>
